# Assignment-2-CS-351

**# Overview**

In this assignment you will apply your knowledge of signals, POSIX shared memory, message
passing, and pipes. To do this, you will implement three different multiprocess applications.
Each application will comprise two processes that have a producer-consumer relationship. The
first process, henceforth the sender, will read a user-specified file and then transfer the file
contents to the second process, henceforth the receiver. The receiver will receive the file contents
and save them to another file.
The difference between the three applications is the inter-process communications (IPC) mech-
anism they use to transfer the file contents. The first application will use the POSIX shared
memory. The second application will utilize POSIX message queues. Finally, the third applica-
tion will use POSIX ordinary pipes to transfer the file data from the parent to the child. All
applications will implement signal handlers for the various signals to ensure a graceful termi-
nation. Furthermore, the security issues related to the IPC will be explored – including the
permissions of the shared memory objects.
The sections that follow outline the differences between the programs.

# Part I: Shared Memory
The sender and the receiver programs will work as follows:
The Receiver:

#1. The receiver shall be started before the sender. It shall be invoked as ./recv from the command line.
#2. When launched, it shall override the default signal handler function for the
SIGUSR1 sig-nal (the signal reserved for custom uses by user programs) with a function called void recvFile(int sigNum). After doing so, the program shall go into a sleeping loop where it will sleep until a SIGUSR1 signal arrives.
#3. Once the SIGUSR1 signal arrives, the program shall invoke the recvFile function. The function shall perform the following operations:

(a) Get the shared memory ID for the shared memory segment named
cpsc351sharedmem. If the segment does not exist, the receiver exits with an error ‘‘Missing shared memory segment!". Otherwise, if the segment exists, the receiver continues to the next step.
(b)The receiver should assume that the shared memory segment in the previous step contains the data from a file that was put there by the sender. The receiver shall then get the size of the shared memory segment, read the data from the entire memory segment, and write the read data to a file called file recv.
(c) Finally, the receiver shall deallocate the shared memory segment and exit.
The Sender:
1.The sender shall be started as ./sender <file name> <ID of the receiver process>. For example, **./sender file.txt 1245**. The first argument represents the name of the file to send and the second represents the process ID of the receiver process. Please note: you can always get the process id of the receiver process using the pidof command. E.g., pidof recv. Of’course, this assumes that the receiver is already running.
2. The sender shall then allocate a shared memory segment named cpsc351sharedmem with permissions of 0600. This is done to ensure that only the processes running with the UID of the current user can access the shared memory contents – important security consideration to ensure that processes from other users cannot spy on the current user through shared memory.
3. The sender shall then get the size of the file whose name was provided in the command line, set the size of the shared memory to the size of the file, and shall then read the contents of the file and write them to the shared memory segment.
4. Finally, the sender program shall send the SIGUSR1 signal to the receiver program that the sender will assume is running. The sender can do this by invoking the kill() system call used for sending signals as kill(SIGUSR1, <pid of the receiver>) . The second argument is the process id of the receiver the user has provided at the command line (NOTE: you will need to convert the pid at the command line from string into integer. That can be done using the atoi() function. E.g., int pid = atoi(argv[2]). The high-level skeletons for the sender and receiver can be found in the skeletons/sharedmem. Some of the command line argument parsing has already been done for you.

# Part II: Message Queues
  
The following outlines the structural and functional requirements of the two programs:
The Receiver:
1. The receiver shall be invoked as ./recv
2. The receiver shall allocate a message queue named cpsc351queue and is configured to hold 10 messages with the maximum message size of 4096 bytes. The receiver shall than call the mq receive() system call that shall do the following.
3. Next, the receiver shall block until the queue contains a message (this is the default behavior of mq receive() as discussed in class).
4. When the message arrives, the receiver shall receive the message and check its length. If the length of the message is greater than 0, then the receiver shall write the message contents into file called file recv and then go back calling mq receive() to wait for another message.
•
If the length of the message is 0, then this means the sender is done sending the
message. The receiver should close the file, deallocate the shared memory segment,
and exit.
•
Each skeleton directory contains a Makefile that you can use to build all programs in
that directory using the command
make
command.
•
When there is a need to run the sender and receiver programs simultaneously, you
can simply run them in different terminals at the same time.
The Sender:
1.
The sender shall be invoked as
./sender <file name>
where
<file name>
is the name of
the file to send to the receiver. For example,
./sender file.txt
will send the file named
file.txt
.
2.
When invoked, the sender shall open the message queue named
cpsc351messagequeue
. If
it does not exist, the sender shall terminate with an error.
3.
Otherwise, the sender shall open the file specified at the command line and proceed as
follows:
(a)
Read at most 4096 bytes from the file.
(b)
Send the bytes read through the message queue using
mq
send()
and a message
priority of 1.
(c)
Repeat the previous steps until the end of file is reached.
(d)
When the end of the file is reached, send an empty message to the receiver with a
priority of 2 to tell the receiver that the sending is done.
4.
Terminate.
The high-level skeletons for the sender and receiver can be found in the
skeletons/mqueues
.
Part III: Message Pipes
The following outlines the structural and functional requirements of the pipes program. This
program will be a little different from the above two as it will involve the transfer of file from
the parent process to a child process across a pipe and therefore will require only one program.
The program shall be invoked as
./pipefile <file>
where
<file>
is the name of the file to
transfer. For example,
./pipefile file.txt
.
The requirements of the parent and child are as follows:
The Parent:
1.
The parent shall create an ordinary POSIX pipe using the
pipe()
system call.
2.
The parent shall then fork a child process.
3.
The parent shall then close the end of the pipe it does not need.
4.
The parent shall then open the file specified at the command file.
5.
The parent shall read the file 4096 bytes at a time, write the read bytes to the to the pipe,
and repeat this step until the end of the file is reached.
6.
Once the end of the file is reached, the parent shall close the end of the pipe it no longer
uses and shall call
wait()
to wait for the child to terminate
The Child:
1.
The child shall close the end of the pipe it does not need.
2.
The child shall open a file called
file
recv
for writing.
3.
The child shall read data 4096 bytes (maximum) at a and writing the bytes to the opened
file until the parent closes its write end of the pipe (as discussed in class, the child will
know this happened when the
read()
system call used to read data from the pipe returns
0 as the number bytes read)
4.
The child shall close the file and exit.
The high-level skeletons for this part can be found in
skeletons/pipes
.
Additional Remarks
•
To perform all file I/O operations, you should use the
open()/read()/write()
system
calls.
•
You can see some of these system calls being used throughout the skeletons.
•
Additional sample file illustrating the use of
open()/read()/write()
can be found in
samples/copyfile.cpp
. The program accepts the source and destination file names
from the command line and copies the source file to the destination file. For example,
./copyfile file1.txt file2.txt
will copy the contents of file
file1.txt
to
file2.txt
.
The program can be compiled as
g++ copyfile.cpp -o copyfile
.
•
File
samples/wp.txt
was provided to test drive the
copyfile
program. You can also use
this file to test your programs to ensure that they work with large files. Your program will
be tested on both large and small files.
BONUS
Rewrite the pipes program such that the parent does not use the
write()
system call to copy
the data from the file to the pipe. Instead have the parent use the
sendfile()
system call. You
can learn more about this system call by running the command
man sendfile
or use online
research.
